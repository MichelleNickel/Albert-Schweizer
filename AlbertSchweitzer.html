                    <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Albert Schweitzer was an extraordinary person and his lifestory speaks for itself. He was incredibly talented and intelligent, but always stayed humble and cared for human life and the people around him. Even when life tried to push him down, he was in debt, captured and had to endure humiliation and bad living circumstances, he prevailed and kept on looking into a better future.<br>
                    Let's all try to let his legacy and philosophies live on in all of us.</p>
